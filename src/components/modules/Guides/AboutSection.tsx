          Ciao! I&rsquo;m Elena, born and raised in the heart of Florence. I&rsquo;ve been guiding travelers through the winding streets of my beautiful city for over 8 years. My passion is connecting visitors with the authentic soul of Tuscany—beyond just the famous monuments.

          With a degree in Renaissance Art History, I can tell you the stories behind every fresco and statue. But more importantly, I know where to find the best gelato, the most authentic ribollita, and the quietest sunset spots that only locals know.
